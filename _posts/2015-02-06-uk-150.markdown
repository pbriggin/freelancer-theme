description: The idea for this contest comes courtesy of the University of Michigan's MPowered Entrepreneurship organization and their 1000 Pitches contest, which started way back in 2007. Our goal is to capture that spirit right here in the Bluegrass, on UK's campus. Both iNET and Awesome Inc want to see students unafraid to throw out new ideas in order to stimulate creativity and entrepreneurial conversation in the community.
